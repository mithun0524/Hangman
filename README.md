# Hangman Game README

## Introduction
Welcome to the Hangman Game! This simple yet entertaining Python game challenges players to guess a word by suggesting letters. With carefully crafted ASCII art for the hangman stages, a curated list of words, and the main game logic, this project is a great way to have fun and improve your programming skills.

## Project Structure

### 1. art.py
The `art.py` module is responsible for providing ASCII art representations of the hangman stages. These visual cues enhance the gaming experience by illustrating the progress and stakes of the game. Feel free to customize the ASCII art to add your own creative touch.

#### Example Usage:
```python
from art import stages

# Display the initial hangman stage
print(stages[0])
```

### 2. words.py
The `words.py` module contains a curated list of words for players to guess. You can customize this list by adding or removing words to tailor the game to your preferences. Make sure to keep the words interesting and varied to keep the game engaging.

#### Example Usage:
```python
from words import word_list

# Select a random word from the list
selected_word = random.choice(word_list)
```

### 3. main.py
The `main.py` module is where the main game logic resides. It handles user input, checks for valid guesses, updates the game state, and determines whether the player has won or lost. You can modify this file to add features, improve the user interface, or tweak the game rules.

#### Example Usage:
```python
from art import stages
from words import word_list

# Your game logic goes here
# ...

# Example: Display the current hangman stage
current_stage = 3
print(stages[current_stage])
```

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (latest version recommended).
3. Run `main.py` to start the game.

```bash
python main.py
```
